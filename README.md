🚀 Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped using Create React App, a popular toolchain for building modern single-page React applications without the hassle of manual configuration.

📑 Scripts Available
Inside the project directory, you can run the following commands:

▶️ npm start
Runs the app in development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to preview 🚀.

Hot reloading is enabled — changes you make will instantly update in the browser.

Build errors and lint warnings will also appear in the console.

🧪 npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

Runs only the tests related to changed files since the last commit.

Learn more about testing in Running Tests.

📦 npm run build
Bundles the app into the build/ folder for production.

Optimizes React for best performance:

✅ Minified JavaScript & CSS

✅ Filenames include unique content hashes

✅ Ready-to-deploy static assets

Learn more in Deployment Guide.

⚡ npm run eject
⚠️ Caution: This is a one-way operation!

Copies all configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.

Gives you full control over build configurations.

Once ejected, you cannot go back.

Suitable only when customization is required beyond CRA’s defaults.

👉 Most projects never need eject. Stick with the curated toolset unless absolutely necessary.
