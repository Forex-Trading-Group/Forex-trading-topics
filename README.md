🎨 My React App
A modern, fast, and scalable React single-page application (SPA) bootstrapped with Create React App.

This project serves as a clean starting point for building interactive user interfaces with React, leveraging best practices such as:

⚡ Fast Refresh & Hot Reloading (real-time updates in development)

📦 Zero Configuration Build (Webpack & Babel preconfigured)

✅ Out-of-the-box Testing (powered by Jest & React Testing Library)

📱 Progressive Web App (PWA) support for offline-first capabilities

🎯 Production-ready build setup with optimized performance

🚀 Quick Start
Clone and install dependencies:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-react-app.git
cd my-react-app
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
npm start
Your app will be running at 👉 http://localhost:3000.

📦 Available Scripts
Command	Description
npm start	Runs app in development mode with hot reloading.
npm test	Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
npm run build	Builds production-ready assets inside /build.
npm run eject	Copies all configuration files into project for full customization (⚠️ one-way).
🧩 Example Code
Here are a couple of sample components to get you started:

✅ Simple Counter Component
jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div style={{ textAlign: "center", padding: 20 }}>
      <h2>🔢 Counter: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>➕ Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>➖ Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
➡️ Usage inside App.js:

jsx
import React from "react";
import Counter from "./Counter";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>🎉 Welcome to My React App</h1>
      <Counter />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
🌍 Example Fetching API Data
jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

function JokeFetcher() {
  const [joke, setJoke] = useState("");

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke")
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setJoke(`${data.setup} - ${data.punchline}`));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>
      <h3>😂 Random Joke</h3>
      <p>{joke || "Loading..."}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default JokeFetcher;
